Action creators are exactly that—functions that create actions. It's easy to conflate the terms “action” and “action creator”, so do your best to use the proper term.

In Redux, action creators simply return an action:

. Remember that actions only describe the fact that something happened, but don't describe how the application's state changes.

Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.

 This tutorial is for  people who is  completely new to Redux  and haven't disptched any action yet .
 When we start to  learn some new programming language or framework  the first thing we about to do is to  write "Hello world" , in other words to perform some tiny  task .So to say "Hello World" in Redux would be equal to 
 dispatch a simple action . But somehow for me it wasn't an easy  task at all .Actually I had spent too much time before I finally succeeded to dispatch first action.My thoughts was kind of "Should I write Action first or Reducer first.
 And even if I write action and reducer how my React component supposed to know about  both of them and so on. "
